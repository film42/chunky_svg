Chubby Png
=========

This library is inspired by [the Ruby library "Chunky PNG"](https://github.com/wvanbergen/chunky_png).

It is meant as an experiment to play with the idea of representing expressing charts or visualizations in a higher-level language that renders down to SVG.

Project Status
==============

This is a for-fun and for-learning project. It is not being used in any production systems that I am aware of.
